#There is brief intro to how to tackle regression problems in Machine Learning

1. Simple Linear Regression --> learn to split the dataset,train the model, fit data into the model, visualize the results 
2. multiple Linear Regresssion -->
3. polynomial linear Regression -->
4. Support vector Regression --> learn in which situation apply feature scaling.
